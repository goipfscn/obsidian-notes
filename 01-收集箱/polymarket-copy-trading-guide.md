@DextersSolab (Dexter's Lab):
📰 How I publicly turned $150 into $32.7k on copy trading

If you read this thinking copy trading is a form of passive income, stop.

I publicly made $32,700 on copy trading this month, but it was way harder than you think.

I chose this way of making money on Polymarket because I don't have enough knowledge in politics or economy to earn from classic markets.

However, I’m good at on-chain analysis.

I can easily spend hours digging into someone's transactions hoping to find a solid wallet to follow.

And that’s exactly what I’ve been doing since the start of 2026.

If you wanna start, bear in mind that you will have to manage your wallets daily, not just chilling while your money stacks.

Every day I:

> Watch my traders’ progress

> Delete wallets with bad performance

> Spend hours finding new wallets I can use

> Test different tools and configs

If you're ready to do the same, read this guide.

I will break down exactly how I do that, include everything i learned since I started and share some wallets worth following.

Hope this will help you just as it helped me after losing on manual trading.

## Potential of copy trading

Most people lose on Polymarket for one simple reason:

They trade markets they don’t truly understand.

Look at the most popular sectors:

> Politics

> Weather

> Economy

> Sports

Each of these areas rewards deep, specialized knowledge.

You might understand crypto very well, but that does not mean you understand US election dynamics or hurricane modeling.

And on Polymarket, you are not trading against random retail traders.

You are trading against lawyers, political analysts, data scientists and industry insiders

Copy trading changes the game.

Instead of trying to become an expert in everything, you allocate capital to people who already are.

Have you  ever thought about that?

## How to find best wallets (the right way)

This is the most important part.

Do NOT choose wallets based only on big profit numbers.

A whale can make $50,000 with only 5% return.

If you copy with $200, your result will be tiny (and after fees maybe nothing).

Instead, focus on these factors:

1. Consistency

Look for at least 2-3 months of steady results.

You want smooth growth, not one lucky spike.

If the chart goes straight up in one day, leave it..

2. Trade frequency

Good range: from 30 to 200 trades per month.

Too few trades = maybe luck.

Too many trades = likely bot or spread farmer.

You want active but controlled behavior.

3. Specialization

The best traders focus on 1-3 niches.

For example:

> Only US politics

> Only weather markets

> Only specific sports

Specialists usually outperform generalists, no one can be an exper in everything.

4. Drawdown control

Every trader loses sometimes, but what matters is how they lose.

Do they:

> Cut losses quickly?

> Avoid doubling down emotionally?

> Keep overall curve positive over time?

Zoom out. Always zoom out.

You can't just start copy trading a guy without checking the history of his trades.

## Where to find those wallets?

Polymarket does not show advanced statistics directly.

To properly analyze wallets, you should use tracking platforms that show:

> Win rate

> Historical PnL

> Trade history

> Deposits and withdrawals

> Position sizes

And one thing to remember: Win Rate alone is not enough.

Why? Imagine this:

> Trader A wins 80% of trades but risks $1 to make $0.20.

> Trader B wins 60% of trades but risks $0.40 to make $0.80.

Trader B might be much stronger long term.

He takes more risk, but makes more money.

In any case, choose traders that are close to you by risk management.

You can copy trade those who make +5% each trade and compound if that strategy fits your needs.

But always look for:

> Stable position sizing

> Logical scaling into positions

> Focused categories

Data protects you from emotional decisions.

Here's how i find those wallets through polymarketanalytics.com

1. Open the website and click "Traders", then "Filters"

2. Use my parameters:

> Overall PnL: from $15,000 to $400,000

> Current value: at least $5,000

> Active positions: at least 2

> Total positions: at least 20

> Win Rate: at least 70%

3. Click "Apply filters"

In 3 clicks you erased all the noise so now your task will be to check each wallet and choose the best ones.

## Copy trading setup

Once you have solid wallets, it's time to set up your bot.

One thing you must know: the competition is HUGE.

If you found a good trader, he might be already followed by tens or even hundreds of guys like you.

But there’s a way to stay ahead: use the fastest bot available.

The speed is the key factor that determines your result.

I spent months testing every bot currently available and free to use and chose this one because of the fastest execution and the lowest fees

Link: [https://t.me/KreoPolyBot?start=ref-dexter]

The main task now is to set up the right settings so your bot works correctly.

Here’s the setup I’ve been using for the past month:

1) Click Start and pick Polymarket

2) Click Copy Trade and Add Task

3) Insert the wallet address and name it (use smth like 90% Win Rate guy / politics insider etc)

4) Pick a trading option

There are 4 trading options:

> Fixed (You enter $50 so every trade is $50)

> Exact (Same amount as trader's amount)

> Percentage (If you enter 20% and trader uses $100, your trade = $20)

> Portfolio (If trader uses 10% of his balance, you use 10% of your balance too)

I work with fixed amounts or portfolio based options.

5) Leave 5% slippage, then choose odds range (i use the default one)

6) Set percentage stop loss (I picked 70%)

This feature is a lifesaver, you won't find it anywhere else.

7) Skip the next step and pick Buys + Sells as the last part

That's it.

Now just click Confirm -> Back -> Start and your bot will start working.

Make sure to check your setup, it must say "Running"

Leaving a video guide just in case.

Now you know how to find decent wallets, where to look for them and how to use the main tool.

Most importantly:

Review your wallets daily.

If a wallet changes behavior, reduce exposure.

Copy trading is active management, not passive income.

## Wallets you shouls avoid

This part can save you a lot of money.

There are a lot of bots on Polymarket.

They ay have a 99% win rate and crazy PnL, but they make money on tiny spreads that you won't catch.

A lot of traders start copy trading them and lose hard so this part is crucial.

So if you see tens of transactions per minute, just skip this wallet.

Also don't even check one-event “insiders”

A wallet wins one huge bet so everyone starts copying.

Next event - no edge.

Be careful with short track records, always look for those who win constantly.

Low-liquidity traders are also a risk.

If someone trades very small markets, your copy size might move the price.

You become their exit liquidity so avoid those guys too

If you can avoid them, then you gonna make it.

## Risk management

Even the best trader in the world can have losing weeks.

If you copy without risk control, one bad streak can destroy months of profit.

Set clear rules:

> Maximum drawdown per wallet (for example 15-20%)

> Stop copying if behavior changes

> Rebalance monthly

> Diversify across different sectors

Also avoid correlation.

If three wallets all trade the same political narrative, one news event can hit all at once.

Diversification reduces shock risk.

If you want long-term success, think like a fund manager.

You are not a fan.

You are allocating capital.

Ask yourself regularly:

> Is this trader still focused on their niche?

> Has their position size changed suddenly?

> Has their performance structure changed?

> Is the strategy becoming crowded?

Edges shrink when too many people copy.

Sometimes you must rotate wallets.

Professional copy traders adapt constantly, that's part of the game.

## My copy trading result example

There're around 10 wallets i copy trade.

But every week the list changes because of rotations.

Here's the one I publicly gave multiple times:

[Embedded Tweet: https://x.com/i/status/2023154032303579370]

I found him and shared here when he had only 20 trades and started copy trading him.

Result? He doubled his balance on CS:GO and LoL markets in one month.

Over $50k PnL with 90% Win Rate and low amount of trades.

His wallet address: 0x25e28169faea17421fcd4cc361f6436d1e449a09

Perfect example of a trader focused on one exact niche.

Still following him and waiting for his next move.

## Conclusion + my results

Copy trading on Polymarket can be powerful.

It allows you to:

> Access specialized knowledge

> Reduce emotional trading

> Diversify across domains

But it is not automatic profit.

Success depends on careful wallet selection, proper risk management and continuous monitoring.

If you treat it as a structured system, it can outperform solo trading.

If you treat it as blind imitation, you will fund someone else’s edge.

Build slowly.

Stay analytical.

Protect capital first.

Once again, only this month I almost hit $35k PnL using this strategy.

My wallet is public and free for everyone, I am sharing everything in my TG channel daily.
